    "The goal of the project is to create a deep learning network to predict DNA accessibility across multiple Arabidopsis experiments. The data is available on zenodo. It contains both raw read coverage files (aka BigWig files) and peak files in BED format, like the files you used in Assignment 3.  For the project, consider the problem as a regression problem, i.e. your task is to predict predict read coverage rather than the presence of peaks.\n",

    "In training and evaluating your models, we suggest you use chromosomes 1-4 for training and validation and chromosome 5 for testing.\n",

    "In your project we expect you to evaluate different architectures (e.g. purely convolutional vs transformer), explore them in terms of depth and other aspects of the design (e.g. regulation and other features such as layer normalization), and perform an analysis of the filters learned by the network.  The objective is for you to develop some intuition of what works or doesn't work in this domain.\n",
